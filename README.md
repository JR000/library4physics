  * Newton's method
* Implementation of Euler's scheme for solving Cauchy's problem
* Integration methods:
  * Squares (right, left, middle - all both with custom and even grids)
  * Trapeces (custom and even grids)
  * Simpson's method
* Linear regression methods:
  * Implementation of the Least squares method:
    * approximation by one parameter linear function
* Numerical differetiation
  * using Lagrange's interpolational polynom
